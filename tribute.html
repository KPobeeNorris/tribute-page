    <h4 id="writing"> Agatha Christie is a truly inspirational woman and the only person I felt was worthy of creating a tribute page for. Agatha was an author of crime novels, and is probably best known for her characters Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.  Unbelievably, or perhaps not, she is <strong>the</strong> best-selling author after selling over two billion copies of her novels, and they have been translated in to 44 languages.  She was born in Torquay, Devon in 1890 and as a Devonian myself I am proud to have been born in the same county.  </h4>
    <h4 id="writing">As Agatha wrote over 60 novels, short stories and poetry collections a full list would be too much for this page, so I have picked out a few of my favourites:</h4>
    <div>
      <ul id="novel-list">
        <li>The Murder on the Links (Hercule Poirot)      - 1923</li>
        <li>The Big Four (Hercule Poirot)                 - 1927</li>
        <li>Death at the Vicarage (Miss Marple)           - 1930</li>
        <li>Murder on the Orient Express (Hercule Poirot) - 1934</li>
        <li>A Death in the Clouds (Hercule Poirot)        - 1935</li>
        <li>The A.B.C. Murders (Hercule Poirot)           - 1936</li>
        <li>Appointment With Death (Hercule Poirot)       - 1938</li>
        <li>The 4.50 From Paddington (Miss Marple)        - 1957</li>
        <li>At Betram's Hotel (Miss Marple)               - 1965</li>
        <li>Third Girl (Hercule Poirot)                   - 1966</li>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 id="writing">In addition to writing Agatha travelled the world extensively, had a keen interest in archaeology and poisons; the knowledge of which she uses in her writing.  Agatha had her own mystery when in December 1926 she disappeared from her home and sparked a nation-wide manhunt.  Nearly two weeks later she was found in Yorkshire, but it was never fully understood why she disappeared, or what she had been doing during that time period. </h4>
        <h4 id="writing">In summary, Agatha is one of those people that is worth getting to know, and I would have loved to have had the chance to buy her a pot of tea.  She lived a full life and may never have had an inkling that her work would have continued to have been so popular.  Thus, I'd like to close with my favourite quote of Agatha's as this really spoke to me as it sums up the people I hold dear to me --</h4>
