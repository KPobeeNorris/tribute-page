    <h4> Agatha Christie is a truly inspirational woman and the only person I felt was worthy of creating a tribute page for. Agatha was an author of crime novels, and is probably best known for her characters Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.  Unbelievably, or perhaps not, she is <strong>the</strong> best-selling author after selling over two billion copies of her novels, and they have been translated in to 44 languages.  She was born in Torquay, Devon in 1890 and as a Devonian myself I am proud to have been born in the same county.  </h4>
    <h4>As Agatha wrote over 60 novels, short stories and poetry collections a full list would be too much for this page, so I have picked out a few of my favourites:</h4>
